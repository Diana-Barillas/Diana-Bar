Hi there, my name is Diana ☀️

I’m an Economics student turned Software Engineer.  My experience in engineering and design piqued my interest in using my problem-solving abilities in the tech sector as a front-end engineer!
* 📍   I am a Junior, pursuing Bachelors in Economics at Cal State LA.
* 🌲  I’m interested in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Web Development and Programming.
* 📚  I'm in the process of expanding my skills in React and TypeScript but open to learning any tools! Constantly brainstorming my next blog-post topic
* 🌎  I am currently focusing on Data Structures and Algorithm in Java and DevOps. A beginner contributor at Open Source. 
* 🐠+ always exploring ways to expand my knowledge on new projects relating to product management and art(would love to collaborate on any projects that involving those topics!)
